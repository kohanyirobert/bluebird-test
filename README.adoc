= `bluebird`

This is an example project I've made for a headhunter company to land a job.

The goal of the application is to simulate a city's power consumption/production, storing house-level data in a database.

It features

* JPA and Hibernate - to store power consumption/production data. 
* Apache Derby - used as an in-memory database.
* Maven - to create shippable distribution packages using assemblies.
* TestNG - for simple unit tests.

I got the job, the code remains and in retrospect it looks and works damn well!

NOTE: The source contains a few comments in Hungarian as it was a requirement. 

== Running

Run `./mvnw clean package` then unpack the appropriate distribution archive created in the `target/` folder and run the program.

```
./mvnw clean package
unzip -d dist target\bluebird-test-1-cmd.zip
cd dist/bluebird-test-1
default.cmd
help
```

NOTE: Use the archived tagged with `sh` on Linux/OS X.
