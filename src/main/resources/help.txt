Enter one of the commands just below and press enter.

             help - Prints this.
            usage - Prints information on how to invoke the program from the
                    command-line and gives some information on the available
                    options.
             args - Prints the arguments the program was invoked with.
           params - Same as arg.
 horizontal table - Prints a *big-ass* table. It contains every (relevant)
                    piece of information in the in-memory database.

                    If your terminal isn't wide enough, then try resize it, so
                    that the table could fit on screen in its entire glory!
            table - Same as horizontal table.
   vertical table - Prints the same stuff as with horizontal table but in a
                    longer, probably more readable format.
             vert - Same as vertical table.
             town - Prints the summarized town-wide consumption.
           street - Prints summarized street-wise consumptions.

                    This parameter accepts a single argument: a street name. If
                    supplied the summary will be printed only for that street.

                    E.g. "street Coronita Parkway"

                    (It's case-sensitive, no additional whitespace allowed.) 
         building - Prints summarized per building consumptions.

                    Accepts a building name parameter in the same fashion as
                    street does.
            house - Prints summarized consumptions per household.

                    Just as street and building this command also accepts an
                    argument: the house/residence name.
             exit - Exits the program.
             quit - Same as quit.
